                        Paul studied Computer Systems Engineering at the University of Alaska-Anchorage before dropping out to take a job at a Silicon Valley startup.
                        When he founded DataShark with Joshua Spring in May 2017, he told his California boss he'd be working remotely from now on, loaded up his van, and headed back to Anchorage without looking back.
